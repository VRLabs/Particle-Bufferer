## How to use

You can run the tool by right clicking on one or more GameObjects and using the options under `Effects` -> `Particle Bufferer`.

These options are:

- From Selected: Creates a new Buffer Particle with all the selected Particle Systems as sub-emitters.
- For Each Selected: Creates a new Buffer Particle for each selected Particle System.
- Empty: Creates a new Buffer Particle System on the selected GameObjects (at the scene root if no GameObjects are selected).

> [!NOTE]  
> When building for Quest, you will have to remove unsupported components and shaders
